# Retail-Demand-Pricing-Machine-Learning
This project applies data-driven techniques and machine learning to optimize **retail demand forecasting**, **inventory management**, and **pricing strategy**. By analyzing historical sales data, promotions, seasonality, and external factors, the models aim to support better business decisions in retail operations.

## 🧠 Project Objectives

- Forecast product demand with ML models
- Analyze the impact of promotions, pricing, and seasonality
- Optimize inventory planning to reduce stockouts and overstocking
- Identify customer segment behavior and price sensitivity
- Compare multiple regression models for predictive accuracy
## 📁 Dataset Description

The dataset includes:

- `Sales Data`: Historical transaction records with date, product, and store identifiers
- `Inventory Levels`: Stock availability across stores
- `Pricing & Promotions`: Product prices and active promotional status
- `External Factors`: Weather, competitor pricing, and economic indicators
- `Customer Segments`: Premium, regular, and budget categories
